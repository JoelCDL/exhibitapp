      <h2>Responsive Image Test</h2>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> On Chrome, after the biggest img listed in srcset is selected, Chrome will cache it and won't pick the smaller images in srcset after resizing the browser (a feature, not a bug). Firefox and Safari will still swap out each image on browser resize, even after they are cached.</p>

        <div class="res__container">
            
            <img
            src="http://placehold.it/400x400"
            class="res__img"
            srcset="http://placehold.it/400x400 400w, http://placehold.it/600x600 600w,
            http://placehold.it/800x800 800w"
            sizes="(min-width: 800px) 800px, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"
            alt="responsive image">

        </div>

        <p><strong>For the example below:</strong> The 'sizes' attribute is set to '100vw' to scale to 100% of container. For the 'w' attribute, the number preceeding the 'w' should equal the breakpoints in the responsive design.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid">
            
            <div class="col-xs-4">
                
                <img
                src="http://placehold.it/400x400"
                class="res__img"
                srcset="http://placehold.it/600x600 600w, http://placehold.it/800x800 800w,
                http://placehold.it/1000x1000 1000w"
                sizes="100vw"
                alt="responsive image">

            </div>
