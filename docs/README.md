Docco Documentation
-----------------------------

Docco is listed in `devDependences` in `package.json` and should install as part of `npm install`. Docco converts comments into inline documentation in static HTML pages located in the `/docs` folder of this repo. Documentation has been checked in to the repo to provide easy timestamping for the last build of the docs.

To build the docs run: 

```
node_modules/docco/bin/docco app/scripts/*.js
```

JavaScript Overview
------------------------------

Generally, templating and data marshalling happens server side in Django templates and views, respectively. The templates are served to the client as either a page, an AJAX response, or a PJAX response. The JavaScript then resolves its state with the server's response - hence the `QueryManager`'s `getQueryFromDOM` and `getItemInfoFromDOM` functions. 

Scripts are loaded in the following order (from `/calisphere/templates/calisphere/scripts.html` for devMode and `/app/index.html` for production)

`/calisphere/templates/calisphere/scripts.html`
```
  <script src="{% static "scripts/Controller.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/QueryManager.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/ExhibitPageView.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/FacetFormView.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/ItemView.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/ComplexCarouselView.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/GlobalSearchFormView.js" %}"></script>
  <script src="{% static "scripts/ContactOwnerFormView.js" %}"></script>
  ...
  <script src="{% static "scripts/calisphere.js" %}"></script>
```

`/app/index.html`
```
  <!-- build:js(app) scripts/calisphere.js -->
  <script src="scripts/Controller.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/QueryManager.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/ExhibitPageView.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/FacetFormView.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/ItemView.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/ComplexCarouselView.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/GlobalSearchFormView.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/ContactOwnerFormView.js"></script>
  <script src="scripts/calisphere.js"></script>
  <!-- endbuild -->



  <!-- build:js scripts/calisphere-home.js -->
  <script src="scripts/calisphere-home.js"></script>
  <!-- endbuild -->
```

[`calisphere.js`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/calisphere.html ) is the last loaded file and kicks everything else off - start here to follow what happens when a page is loaded. `calisphere.js` creates `qm`, the globally namespaced [`QueryManager`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/QueryManager.html), as well as the globally namespaced [`globalSearchForm`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/GlobalSearchFormView.html), and then uses the `setupComponents` function in [`Controller.js`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/Controller.html) to determine which components to create/destroy based on which selectors are available in the DOM. 

The homepage is the one place where `calisphere.js` is **not** used. For the homepage, the only JavaScript loaded is in [`calisphere-home.js`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/calisphere-home.html). 

A bit about namespacing
----------------------------

All components are created as subcomponents of the `globalSearchForm`. This means, at any given point in time, you can type `globalSearchForm` into the console and components should exist as properties of the `globalSearchForm` (see list below). Likewise, `qm` is available in the global namespace. Typing `qm.attributes` into the JavaScript console will print the current query state, and should always match `sessionStorage`. 

Calisphere Components:
* if `#js-facet` selector in DOM, create a [`FacetFormView`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/FacetFormView.html) attached to `globalSearchForm` at `globalSearchForm.facetForm`
* if `#js-carouselContainer` selector in DOM, create a [`ItemView`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/ItemView.html) attached to `globalSearchForm` at `globalSearchForm.carousel`
* if `#js-contactOwner` selector in DOM, create a [`ContactOwnerFormView`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/ContactOwnerFormView.html) attached to `globalSearchForm` at `globalSearchForm.contactOwnerForm`
* if `.carousel-complex` selector in DOM, create a [`ComplexCarouselView`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/ComplexCarouselView.html) attached to `globalSearchForm` at `globalSearchForm.complexCarousel`
* if `#js-exhibit-title` selector in DOM, create a [`ExhibitPageView`](http://amywieliczka.github.io/public_interface/ExhibitPageView.html) attached to `globalSearchForm` at `globalSearchForm.exhibitPage`

Calisphere Components
----------------------------

Calisphere components extend the [Backbone.js View class](http://backbonejs.org/#View) while the `QueryManager` extends the [Backbone.js Model class](http://backbonejs.org/#Model). Check out http://backbonejs.org/#Model-View-separation for an introduction to how Backbone Models and Views are related. 

Calisphere components tend to have a few distinct flavors of methods:
* User-Interaction Event Handlers (specified in the `events` dictionary and attached by default on component creation)
* PJAX Event Handlers (always defined in the form `pjax_<pjax event name>` and bound in a component's `initialize` function)
* Window resize event handler (always called `changeWidth`. The `GlobalSearchFormView.changeWidth(<window width>)` calls each component's changeWidth function. `globalSearchForm.changeWidth` is called in `calisphere.js`.)
* Lifecycle methods: `initialize`, `render`, and `destroy`. 

**Component Lifecycle**

- Initialize (required)
If a component's `render` method is defined, `initialize` will always instruct the component to `listenTo` a `change` on the component's `model` (in our case, always `qm`) and call the component's `render` method.
If a component's `changeWidth` method is defined, `initialize` will always call the `changeWidth` function to ensure the component is drawn up correctly on initialization. 
Finally, all PJAX event handlers must be attached (`.on`) by a persistent name in `initialize`. 

- Render (optional)
If a component defines a `render` method, this is the method called on the view when the query state changes. 

- Destroy (required in most cases, optional if none of the following exist)
All PJAX event handlers must be detached (`.off`) by a persistent name in `destroy`. 
If a component has been instructed to `listenTo` changes in the component's model in `initialize` then the component must `stopListening` in `destroy`.
`this.undelegateEvents()` must be called to detach user-interaction events specified in the `events` dictionary of a component. 

Creating a New Component - other files you need to modify 
-------------------------------

1. Create file in `/app/scripts/`
2. Specify `/*exported <ClassName> */` at the top of the component's file. 
2. Add file to scripts list in `/calisphere/templates/calisphere/scripts.html` for devMode and `/app/index.html` for production
3. Specify class name in `/* global */` list in `Controller.js`
3. In `setupComponents` function in `Controller.js`, add an `if($(<selector>).length) {} else if (globalSearchForm.<componentName>) {}` block. 
4. In `changeWidth` method of `GlobalSearchFormView`, add a call to the component's `changeWidth` method (if it exists).

General Notes About Debugging JS
-----------------------------

Using Chrome's Developer Tools, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript by navigating to the Sources tab, then in the list on the left, selecting `localhost:9000/scripts/<filename>`, and clicking the line number next to the line where you want to set a breakpoint. 

Once you've hit a breakpoint, you can watch variable values by adding them to the Watch panel on the right, or actually type JavaScript to be run immediately by switching to the Console tab - you'll have access to whatever variables are currently in scope and can actually manipulate them during the breakpoint. 

Returning to the Sources tab, you can step through the JavaScript using the controls at the top of the right-hand panel. 

JQuery (`$`) is available globally, along with `qm`, `globalSearchForm`, and `sessionStorage`. 

Debugging on production or on calisphere-test is significantly more challenging, since the JavaScript is minified there. If you must, though, Chrome's Dev Tools can attempt to pretty-print minified JS. Once you've selected `calisphere.js` in the Sources panel, Chrome should ask 'Pretty-print this minified file?' Click the `{}` in the bottom left hand corner of the source panel to pretty-print.
