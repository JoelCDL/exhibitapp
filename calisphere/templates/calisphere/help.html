<h1>About Calisphere</h1>

		<p>Calisphere brings together thousands of digital images, texts, audio and video recordings from the University of California and other educational and cultural institutions across the state. Review our frequently asked questions for help finding, using, and obtaining more information about these materials.</p>

		<h2>What are my options for finding content on Calisphere?</h2>

		<p>Currently Calisphere offers three main ways into the collections:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Search</strong>: Find items and related collections using keyword searches. See below for search tips.</li>
			<li><strong>Browse by institution</strong>: Explore the libraries, archives, and museums that have contributed collections to Calisphere. View all <a href="/institutions/uc-partners/">University of California contributors</a> and our <a href="/institutions/statewide-partners/">statewide partners</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Browse by collection</strong>: Collections are groups of items related by format, topic, or creator. They provide context for materials. Browse collections <a href="/collections/">at random</a>, <a href="/collections/num/">from A-Z</a>, or with a <a href="/collections/titleSearch/">title search</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Do you have any search tips?</h2>

		<p>Yes indeed.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Exact phrase</strong>: To find items with an exact phrase, use quotes [" "] around your keyword phrase. For example: "sierra buttes" or "Malcolm X."</li>
			<li><strong>Truncation</strong>: An asterisk [*] can be used as a wildcard to replace one or many characters. For example: farm* will retrieve farm, farmers, farming, farmhouse, farmers' market, etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Boolean search</strong>: Our search does not support Boolean operators (<span class="text-uppercase">and</span>, <span class="text-uppercase">or</span>, <span class="text-uppercase">not</span>). However, entering a multiple keyword search will work like Boolean <span class="text-uppercase">and</span>. Results will be returned only when <span class="text-uppercase">all</span> of the keywords appear. For example: sierra mining will retrieve items with both sierra and mining.</li>
			<li><strong>Filters</strong>: Use filters to further refine a search and drill down into items of interest. When you filter by item type (format), decade, contributing institution, and collection, your search results will automatically refresh.</li>
			<li><strong>Sort</strong>: Organize your search results according to what’s important to you. Sort by relevance (the prevalence of your search terms in item information), title alphabetically and reverse, or date.</li>
			<li><strong>Views</strong>: Change the view of your results to suit your research style. The thumbnail view (default) lets you see a lot of items at once. Toggle the list view to see bigger images and more information. Your search results will also display at the top of the item you select, so you can keep track of where you are within a result set.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why do I have to go another website to zoom, download, and play some items but not others?</h2>
